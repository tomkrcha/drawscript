Drawscript is discontinued
==========
**The project isn't currently under active development.**

It used to be a plugin that turned Illustrator shapes into graphics code - Obj-C, C++, JavaScript, Processing, ActionScript 3, JSON, raw bezier points.

There is no download available anymore at this point.
